## 2026-09 — Plan adopted, core geometry built

**Phase 0 is partially pre-answered by existing results.** The source plan's stop condition
("if the signal is invisible in DINOv2 space, stop — no dynamics head can fix an encoder
problem") is already closed in the encoder's favour: a linear probe on the *predicted* latent
recovers future block tilt at AUC 0.941, and per-patch divergence localises ground-truth
motion at patch-AUC 0.955–0.960. Perception is not the bottleneck; the readout/dynamics is.

**We already have direct evidence for the plan's central premise.** `results/` contains an
exact analytic-Jacobian FTLE run on the current causal-ViT head: AUC 0.617, *worse* than plain
`d_end` (0.827). The linearisation test showed why — the linear regime ends at ‖δ‖≈1e-3, about
50× below the operating σ=0.05, where relative error is 0.963 and the predicted displacement
direction has only 0.538 cosine with truth. The Jacobian is correct and useless. That is the
measured version of "a smooth network can only steepen a discontinuity, never represent it",
and it is a result in its own right, not just a citation.

**Named risk, owner Phase 4:** our largest empirical win is *spatial* patch masking
(0.756 → 0.894 by keeping low-motion background patches). The shPLRNN wants a single
low-dimensional state. Naively pooling patches into d=32 may destroy exactly that structure.
Apply the mask before pooling, and measure whether the gain survives. If it does not, that is
a publishable finding about the cost of dimensionality reduction for this signal.

### Core geometry — built and tested

`src/models/shplrnn.py`, `src/geometry/jacobian.py`, `src/geometry/ftle.py`,
`tests/test_geometry.py` (7 tests, all passing). Two design decisions worth recording:

1. **`lyapunov_spectrum` sorts descending before returning.** Benettin/QR exponents are only
   asymptotically ordered, so an unsorted return made `spec[0] == lambda_max` unreliable at
   finite T. Sorting breaks the correspondence between exponent *i* and column *i* of Q — if
   covariant directions are ever needed, use the unsorted logs. Documented in the docstring.
2. **Two test bugs found and fixed while writing them**, both worth noting because they are
   the same class of error the plan warns about:
   - the "known linear system" test let expanding modes (|A|>1) grow the state over 200 steps
     until it crossed the switching hyperplanes, so the system stopped being linear mid-test
     and the known answer was no longer known. Fixed with a tiny s0, shorter T, and an
     explicit assertion that the gates stay closed.
   - the descending-order test asserted a property the implementation did not yet guarantee.
     Fixed the implementation rather than the assertion.

### Scope boundary carried in from prior work

This plan is about **detection**. Optimising actions *against* an FTLE-style score was tested
directly and made things worse: real topple rate 15% → 40% (McNemar p=0.013) while the score
itself fell 26%, and statistically indistinguishable from random perturbations of matched
magnitude (p=0.83). A good passive detector is not automatically a valid control objective.
If the shPLRNN's geometry proves genuinely better, that conclusion deserves a re-test — as an
explicit guarded experiment, not an assumption.
